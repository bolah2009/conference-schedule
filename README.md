# Final Capstone Project: Conference Schedule

## Project Specifications

### The objective is to build a conference schedule based on the following design guide:

- A user can log in or/and sign up on the app.
- A user is presented with a list of conference and the agenda page, where the user can look at the general schedule of the conference, day by day
- When a user selects a talk, detailed information about the talk is presented and the possibility add it to the user schedule
- A user can access a list of the user's schedule
- An authentication using `JWT` (JSON web token) allows a user to log in and sign up to the app and authentic access to the user schedule.
- A user table is created with an association to both conferences and schedule tables. Here users have many conferences and schedules.

### Backend

#### Associations

There are four tables created for the backend with the following associations:
User table:
Has many conferences using `creator_id` has the `foreign key`
Has many schedules using user_id as the foreign key
Conference table:
Has many Agendas
Belongs to a user with creator_id as the foreign key
Agenda table belongs to a conference
Schedule table belong to both Agenda and User with a foreign key of agenda_id and user_id respectively
